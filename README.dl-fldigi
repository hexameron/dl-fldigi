- INFO ----------------------------------------------------------------

dl-fldigi is a stand alone modification to fldigi, for use in decoding
balloon telemetry. It will detect telemetry strings and forward them
to a server where the data is processed and plotted on a map
(currently https:///tracker.habhub.org).

dl-fldigi is hosted at http://github.com/jamescoxon/dl-fldigi
The original fldigi is hosted at http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html
See AUTHORS.dl-fldigi for a list of contributors.

This version of dl-fldigi is based off fl-digi 4.0.x

You can see every modification made in full detail on github.

- USAGE ---------------------------------------------------------------

Installation instructions can be found in INSTALL.dl-fldigi

Included is a new slim HAB interface which has additional features
purely for balloon tracking; the normal interface still exists and can
be used, however it will lack some of the additional features. To
access the new interface, dl-fldigi should be run with the --hab
argument.

Once you have opened up the new interface, you can select the payload
you plan to track in the drop down box on the left. Next, press the
"Autoconfigure" button on the right and you will be set up to track.
Remember that it is important that you have filled in your operator
details (Configure -> Waterfall -> Operator) else your data will not
be uploaded. Also, your location should be entered in decimal form
('-' rather than S or W e.g. 52.0100, -0.42323).

- BUGS ----------------------------------------------------------------

This is very much an ongoing effort, and we expect dl-fldigi to evolve
rapidly with the growing balloon community. Please report any issues
to our mailing list: ukhas@googlegroups.com
