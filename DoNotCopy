This is not free software. Hardware Acceleration for Raspberry Pi requires an external library that is not covered by the GPL. For convenience this has been included alongside the Fl-digi source code and modified under a seperate licence from Broadcom. The Broadcom Licence is not compatible with the GPL, so redistribution in Binary form is not acceptable. The GPU code will need to be compiled to a seperate executable file for compliance. Redistribution of Source needs to respect the distinction between FL-digi and the Broadcom library.
