Hardware Acceleration for Raspberry Pi requires firmware that is not covered by the GPL. For convenience this has been included alongside the Fl-digi source code. The headers needed to load firmware are covered under a BSD licence from Broadcom.

The Fldigi Authors allow joint licencing by GPLv3 or the Lesser GPL.

Source code for the firmware cannot be released, but Andrew Holme has authorised reverse engineering: open source tools exist to disassemble, modify and reassemble the GPU FFT code, so it is available as Open Source.
