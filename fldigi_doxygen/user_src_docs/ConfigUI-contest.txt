Fldigi supports a full range of contests. Each contest's unique data
exchange is captured either in a generic multi word exchange field, or in
contest specific fields that are displayed in the main dialog logging group.

Select the contest type from the Contest combo:

If you select the State QSO parties, you need to make a second selection
for the specific state, area, region contest in which you be participating.

\image html config-ui-contest-select-SQSO.png "UI Contest"

Enter the exchange you want to send. You can force
the RST in/out to always be 599. That seems to be a norm for many
contests. When operating in a CW contest you can have fldigi send
cut numbers, T for 0, N for nine.
<br>
The serial number can be set to use leading zeros.  You can specify the
starting number for the sequence and how many digits are sent, ie:
0024. Pressing Reset will set the starting number to the QSO logging
serial out field. See \ref contest_how_to_page "Contest How To" for more
info.
<br>

You can check for duplicates by any combination of the specified named
fields. You can also specify that the duplicate had to occur with a
given time interval. Some VHF contests allow a duplicate CALL after
a given time interval.

\section n3fjp_logger N3FJP logger connection

Fldigi and the N3FJP logging software have been interfaced to form a 
very powerful combination that allows the avid contester to perform CW 
and digital communications in the most popular ARRL, National, International, 
and State contests. This combination also assists the Handi-ham in communicating 
in CW. They allow the operator to send and receive contest exchanges as well 
as control their rig.  The N3FJP logger behaves as a log data base server
and fldigi the modem client for the purposes of data exchange.

Since the contests differ greatly in their exchanges, these instructions 
will be rather lengthy and will have many screen shots. These instructions 
will be broken down by contests that are similar and require similar settings.

Although the contests are varied, certain parts of the set up are the same 
for all. These include the Sound Card (Rig Interface such as Rig Blaster, 
Signalink, or home brew) and the API (Application Program Interface.) 

The first thing that you will need to do is to bring up the N3FJP program 
for the contest that you want to participate in. To do this go to 
http://www.n3fjp.com and select it from the Contest Logs drop down menu. 
The N3FJP logger software is independently sold and distributed by Scott 
and Kimberly Davis. 

Either fldigi or the N3FJP logger can be started first.  When so configure
fldigi will periodically attempt to connect to the logger.  The two programs
can reside on a single or multiple computers with LAN access.  The N3FJP
logger will only run on an MS operating system.  fldigi can be on any of the
supported operating systems.  The connection has been tested between Linux,
OS X, and MS operating systems.

\subsection n3fjp_setup N3FJP logger setup

<ul>
<li>Click on Setup and configure your station information.</li>
<li>Set up API.  This is necessary even if both fldigi and the logger
are on the same machine.  Select API from the Setup menu.<br>
Check the box in the upper section for API port 1100.</li>
</ul>

\subsection fldigi_setup Fldigi setup

<ul>
<li>Open configuration dialog to the UI/Logs/N3FJP... tab</li>
<br>
\image html config-ui-log-n3fjp.png "N3FJP connect"
\image latex config-ui-log-n3fjp.png "N3FJP connect"  width=5.0in
<br>
<li>Enter the LAN address, either as the machine name or it's numeric
uniform resource locator, i.e: LENOVO-DUALBOOT (192.168.1.81)</li>
<li>Check the box "Enable data stream" to view the connect and data transfer
process.</li>
<li>Check the "Connect" box</li>
</ul>

fldigi should connect to the logger with a few seconds.  You will see the
connect stream processing as above, and the GREEN connect triangle should\
illuminate.

Disconnect is as simple as unchecking the "Connect" box.

fldigi will follow suite as you stop and start various N3FJP loggers.  The
fldigi main dialog title bar and it's logging controls will reflect the change
in contest usage.  Here is an example for an automatic connection to the
CQ WW DX contest
