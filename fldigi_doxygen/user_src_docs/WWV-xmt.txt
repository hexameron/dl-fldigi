The WWV mode is normally used to measure the offset of the sound card
oscillator.  see \ref digiscope_display_wwv_mode "WWV ppm measurement".
<br>

It can also be used to transmit time tick signals similar to the format
that is used by WWV.  The WWV modem sends a time tick which is a
200 msec wide pulse at a once per second rate when the T/R button is
enabled.  This pulse is shaped with a 4 msec raised cosine shape
on the leading and trailing edges to reduce key clicks.  The
accuracy of the transmitted time tick is solely dependent on the
accuracy with which the WWV ppm measurement was performed.
<br>

The purpose of the WWV time tick transmission is to allow other
stations to calibrate their sound cards against your calibrated
system.  This can be used to align all systems in a VHF/UHF net
for example.  It is only necessary for one of the net members to
be able to calibrate his or her sound card against WWV.  The
other's would then be calibrated by proxy use of the WWV time tick
transmit mode.  This can even be used in the case where no member has
access to a HF transceiver.  The master station would set the Rx
and Tx ppm settings to zero.  It would then transmit the time tick
signal for the other stations to calibrate their sound cards against
the master sound card.  Having all of the stations calibrated in
this way will insure that the modem decoders will give maximum
performance.  Here is an example of an advanced macro that will send a 
CW announcement, 2 minutes of time ticks and end with another CW announcement.
