The main dialog ifkp user interface provides an Rx-text panel, a Tx-text panel, 
a "Heard" list, and an ifkp signal to noise indicator, and an avatar image.  The
default avatar is the "Tux" logo.  Sending, receiving and saving avatars is discussed
in the avatar section.

Keyboard operation in ifkp is identical to other digital modes such as PSK, MFSK,
DominoEX, etc. with a primary difference; the alphabet is a truncated version of
the MicroSoft Code Page 1250, CP1250.  This alphabet is described in the ifkp varicode
section.

Unlike FSQ, which uses a similar incremental frequency keying technique, IFKP does
not employ any special protocols.  The exception to this rule is for the transmission
and reception of IFKP images.

IFKP transmission and reception can occur anywhere within the nominal passband of
500 to 3500 Hertz.  fldigi will adjust the waterfall tracking point if the center frequency 
selected would create a signal that is either above or below the nominal passband.  
The default audio frequency is 1500 and most operators will elect to use the default.

\section IFKPheard IFKP heard list

The IFKP decoder includes a parser which continuously examines the received text
stream looking for a sequence of characters which begins with \<SP\>de\<SP\>, independent
of case.  \<SP\> is the space character.  The ensuing word is then tested for validity
as a callsign.  The following examples would all be qualified as a valid callsign:
<pre>
" DE W1HKJ "
" de kl7cgf "
" de     W3FQN "
" de K2LBM<LF>"
"<LF>de N2IKY<LF>"
</pre>
Note that the white space can be extended between the "de" and the callsign.  The
callsign can be terminated with either a space character or a new line character.

When a valid callsign is discovered it is added to the heard list along with the time
and detected signal to noise ratio.  New callsigns are always prepended to the top of
the heard list.  Any older heard list entries with the same callsign are purged.

Left clicking on a heard list entry inserts that callsign in the Tx panel at the
cursor position.  Right clicking on a heard list entry deletes that entry from
the list.

\section IFKPspec IFKP specification

IFKP is a incremental frequency keyed mode with an offset of +1.  It is designed 
for very high coding efficiency. This version uses 33 tones (32 differences), 
a Varicoded Alphabet, with a rotating difference frequency.  Modem statistics:
<br>
<center>
|  Parameter   |   Value
:--------------|----------:
Samplerate     | 16000    |
Bandwidth      | 386      |
Center freq    | 1500(1)  |
Symbol length  | 4096     |
Lower case cps | 3.65     |
(1) nominal, adjustable from 500 to 3500 Hertz
</center>
<br>
Tone differences are expressed as decimal numbers 0 - 31.  The alphabet design
uses single-symbol and two-symbol character codes. The character set does not 
include much extended ASCII, and has only 116 different codes.  It is a strongly 
'unsquare' design (29 x 3), which restricts the number of codes, but we don't 
need the maximum anyway. This 'unsquare' code maximizes the single-symbol set to 
29, so will fit all lower case in one symbol. Using 29 initials means using a 
comparison process to discover where the initial symbols are. 
<br>

Amateur communications does not follow standard English text for letter frequency.
It has a higher incidence of letters such as Q, X and Z (in Q codes and callsigns).  
Lower case letters are more common than upper case.  Numbers are considered equal 
in frequency of occurance to upper case characters.
<br>

The IFKP character set has been designed for one set of 29 single-symbol characters, 
and three two-symbol sets of upper case letters, number and punctuation. There 
is some spare space, and a few extended ASCII characters have been included (± ÷ ° £ ×).  
<br>

There are 29 single-symbol characters, 87 two-symbol codes, and a total 
alphabet of 116 codes. This allows coding all upper case, lower case and 
punctuation.  The most common symbol is the NULL, a non printing character 
and is assigned a single symbol entry in the table.  
<br>

The nomenclature used for the character symbol numbers in the tables is 
<pre>
[1st_symbol], ([2nd_symbol])
</pre>
expressed in decimal, where the [1st_symbol] always has values less than 29, 
and the [2nd_symbol] will have a value of 30 or 31.

<br>
It is about 27% more efficient than DominoEX. Note especially the score sending 
typical 'ham speak' - some 30% more efficient than DominoEX. The typing speed at 
3.65 cps is about 37 WPM.  Q codes and callsigns should be sent in lower case when
possible.

\section IFKPspeed IFKP xmt speed

fldigi-ifkp can transmit text in one of 3 speeds, 0.5X, 1.0X and 2.0X.  The 1.0X
speed is the natural speed of the modem.  The 0.5X and 2.0X speeds are obtained by
dividing or multiplying the symbol length by 2 respectively.  You can expect to 
experience decreased decoding errors with the 0.5X speed.  Use it when s/n conditions
are well below minux 10 dB on the IFKP signal strength meter.  The 2.0X speed should
probably not be used unless the s/n is well above plus 10 dB on the IFKP signal
strength meter.

The three speeds can be selected at the time that IFKP is chosen from the mode menu.
The speed can also be changed using the IFKP modem configuration tab.  The quickest
way to change speed is to left click on the left-most status indicator on the fldigi
status bar (lowest set of controls on the main dialog).  A pop-up menu will appear with
the speed selections.  The quick mode change and the configuration tab changes will
occur immediately even during transmission.  The selection from the mode menu will
cause a complete reset of the IFKP modem.

\section IFKPimage IFKP Image Mode

fldigi-ifkp has the ability to transmit and receive small digital images selected
from those stored on the disk.  The image transmission is similar to but not
compatible with the MFSKpic modes.  IFKP images are always transmitted in a fixed
width to height ratio.  The W x H format is not limited to a single ratio, nor is
it limited to just color, or just gray scale.  The image mode is nearly identical
to the FSQ image mode with the exception of the RGB transmission sequence.  IFKP
transmits in Blue-Green-Red order, whereas IFKP transmits in Red-Green-Blue order.
The IFKP image bandwidth is less than 400 Hz.

The start of the picture is signalled digitally, and the receiver simply captures 
data continuously for W lines of H pixels, as requested, resulting in a WxH pixel 
image, then reception stops.

IFKP Image Mode was designed for NVIS propagation on the lower HF bands. 
Unlike SSTV, the pictures are sent relatively slowly, in a narrow bandwidth 
(1/4 of SSTV), and as a result the picture signal to noise ratio is generally 
better than SSTV for the same transmission power. As a guideline, IFKP signals 
(before the picture is started) need to be about +10dB SNR for relatively 
noise-free picture reception.

IFKP pictures also offer significantly better reception than SSTV under NVIS 
conditions. Because there is no picture sync, there is no risk of the picture 
tearing due to timing changes, or breaking up during selective fades. All that 
happens is that the image may noise up momentarily, but will stay correctly 
aligned. The mode is also significantly less affected by ghosting.

<b>Image Format</b>

The images are approximately in 4:3 or 3:4 aspect ratio.  IFKP images can be received
by any IFKP capable decoder.

Available image aspect ratios / formats include:

<ul>
<li>59x74   color
<li>160x120 color
<li>320x240 color
<li>640x480 grey scale
<li>640x480 color
<li>240x300 color
<li>240x300 grey scale
<li>120x150 color
<li>120x150 grey scale
</ul>

These formats correspond roughly to a portrait (3x4) and landscape (4x3) photo.
fldigi will scale any computer stored image to the target image.  You should
edit the images off line to be at least close to the 3x4 or 4x3 ratio.  That will
prevent the fldigi loader from distorting the loaded image.

The image mode sampling rate is 16,000 samples/sec, the same as the text mode. 
Each pixel consists of 8 samples, and there are P pixels/line. Therefore the 
line period is 8 x P/16000 seconds, or the line rate 16000/(8 x P) lines/sec. 
In colour, each line is sent three times, in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) order.

As an example, if there were 320 pixels per line, and 240 lines, the line rate 
would be 6.25 lines/sec, and 240 x 3 (for RGB) lines would take 115.2 seconds, or 
1.92 minutes for a colour picture containing 76,800 pixels.

There is a single sync signal sent at the beginning of each image. This sync signal
is a tone placed 186 Hz below the center frequency, or at 1384 Hertz. The sync signal
is 1.5 symbol lengths in duration, or 5.8 seconds.

If the sound cards in the transmitting and receiving computers differ markedly 
in sample rate, the resulting picture can also be skewed. A small timing 
difference is enough to cause a noticeable slant in the picture. This is easily 
fixed after reception using the Slant control. High quality sound cards should 
be better than 5ppm, and result in barely noticeable slant, but some cheaper 
computer built-in sound modules may be rather worse.  If you plan to send IFKP
images you should calibrate your sound card to WWV.

<b>Transmit Image</b>

Transmitting an image in IFKP is initiated by selecting the "Send image" menu item
from the pop up Tx menu.  Right click on the Tx panel

<center>
\image html ifkp-send-image.png "Send Image"
\image latex ifkp-send-image.png "Send Image" width=2in
</center>

This selection opens up the Send Image dialog

<center>
\image html ifkp-image-xmt.png "Send Image Dialog"
\image latex ifkp-image-xmt.png "Send Image Dialog" width=3.5in
</center>

shown with a 160x120 color image loaded and ready to transmit.

Transmission begins when you press the "Xmt" button.  fldigi will insert the text
preamble and immediately begin the image transmission.  fldigi remains in transmit
mode when the image transmission is completed and the deadman timer is started.

<center>
\image html ifkp-WF-image-mode.png "Image Mode Waterfall"
\image latex ifkp-WF-image-mode.png "Image Mode Waterfall" width=3.5in
</center>

There is an alternate way of sending an image, but one which only transmits a color
image with no provision for slant correction.  This may be more convenient
for sharing images when you do not need the additional utility of the image dialog.
<br>

Open a file folder to the location of your image files that are suitable for MFSK 
transmission.  These images should be constrained to be 240 x 200 or less for 
reasonable transmit times.  Optionally prepare fldigi for the MFSK image 
transmission by entering some suitable text to precede the transmission.  
You may be sending the image, blossoms.jpg, for example.  
<br>

<center>
\image html blossoms.png "image in files folder"
\image latex blossoms.png "image in files folder" width=3.0in
</center>

One might enter:

\image html blossoms-1.png ""
\image latex blossoms-1.png "" width=4.0in

Then drag and drop the the image file from the files folder to the transmit 
text panel in fldigi.  The program will automatically resize the image to the
nearest scale-aspect ratio less than or equal to the actual image size.
<br>

The TX panel text will then change to

\image html blossoms-2.png ""
\image latex blossoms-2.png "" width=4.0in

The ^! is the character sequence used by the fldigi TX parser to indicate 
that there is a pending execution command.  In this case it is to transmit 
the blossoms.jpg file.
<br>

Add some suitable ending text and the sequence ^r to the next line and 
then press the T/R button (if not already transmitting).  At the end of the 
image the TX parser will find the ^r and return the program to the receive 
mode.

The Rx panel will echo the transmitted data:
<br>
\image html thor-pic-transmission.png ""
\image latex thor-pic-transmission.png "" width=4.0in

The transmit progress dialog will close at the conclusion of the image transmission.

<b>Receive Image</b>

Reception is completely automatic.  The decoder will identify the picture start, 
and record the picture. In doing so, it automatically opens a separate "IFKP Rx Image" dialog.

<center>
\image html ifkp-image-partial.png "Image Reception"
\image latex ifkp-image-partial.png "Image Reception" width=3.5in
</center>

Demodulation uses a phase detection algorithm based on quadrature demodulation 
using the current and previous samples at 16000 samples/sec. All the samples are 
converted to pixels and stored, but only the average over every 16 samples is 
displayed.

The raw image is stored in a temporary buffer of expanded size, which allows 
fine adjustment of the slant and phase to be made before the image is sampled 
and displayed.

If the transmitting station goes off the air or reception is lost during 
recording of a picture, the recording will continue until the necessary number 
of samples has been made, then reception stops.

<center>
\image html ifkp-image-completed.png "Image Reception Completed"
\image latex ifkp-image-completed.png "Image Reception Completed" width=3.5in
</center>

The Rx Image dialog controls from left to right are:
- Reset: clears all rx data
- Phase adjustment: moves image left and right
- Slant adjustment: slews image diagonally
- Save: saves the image to the fldigi image folder with a date-time stamped file name
- Close: closes the image dialog

Image phase and slant should not be adjusted before the picture reception has 
finished, as then only part of the image will be corrected.

\section ifkp_avatars Avatars

Avatar images are 59 x 74 (width x height) color images that are associated with
a call sign.  The avatar images are stored in the folder

<pre>
C:\\Documents and Settings\\\<user\>\\fldigi.files\\avatars\\
C:\\Users\\\<user\>\\fldigi.files\\avatars\\
/home/\<user\>/.fldigi/avatars/
</pre>

as "png" images.

You should prepare an image file for your own call sign, in lower case.  For example

<pre>
/home/dave/.fldigi/avatars/w1hkj.png
</pre>

in a 4x5 aspect ratio, preferably in the 59x74 format, but any larger 4x5 image can be used.
fldigi will scale the image to 59x74 when it is read from the file.

You can send your avatar very simply by right clicking on the IFKP avatar.

If you receive an avatar from another station it will automatically be displayed in
the avatar box.  You should have previously entered the call sign of the other station in
the Call logging control.  Left clicking on the avatar will then save the image in the
avatars folder with the appropriate callsign.  The correct avatar will then be displayed
the next time you enter that call sign in the Call logging control.  This is an example
of a received avatar with timing misalignment.

<br>
<center>
\image html ifkp-avatar-1.png "received avatar"
\image latex ifkp-avatar-1.png "received avatar" width=1.0in
</center>
<br>

The received image may be misaligned left or right in the image box.  This is caused
by an error in the start timing of the reception.  You can realign the image using a
combination of SHIFT, CONTROL and LEFT/RIGHT mouse clicks on the image.  Be careful
to use either the SHIFT or CONTROL in combination with the mouse button.  Mouse left
and right click without the SHIFT/CONTROL will cause either a save or an own avatar
transmit to occur.

<pre>
CONTROL LEFT click  - move image left by 1 pixel
SHIFT   LEFT click  - move image left by 5 pixels

CONTROL RIGHT click - move image right by 1 pixel
SHIFT   RIGHT click - move image right by 5 pixels
</pre>

The same image after alignment.

<br>
<center>
\image html ifkp-avatar-2.png "received avatar"
\image latex ifkp-avatar-2.png "received avatar" width=1.0in
</center>
<br>

You will probably need to manage the avatar images using your OS file explorer.  Easy
access to the image folder is obtained by the menu item File/Folders.

The avatar image format is identical to the IFKP image 59x74 format.  If you receive
and save a 59x74 image you can always rename the saved image (date-time-stamped) to
a \"callsign.png\" in the avatar folder.
