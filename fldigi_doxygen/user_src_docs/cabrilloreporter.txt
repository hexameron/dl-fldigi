Fldigi can generate a basic Cabrillo report that meets most contest needs.
<br>

Selecting the "File/Log/Cabrillo report" menu item opens the following
dialog:
<br>

If you want to export every record press the "Check All" in the left
panel.
<br>

Select the Contest type from the pull down menu in the right panel.
Fldigi knows how to format the various fields for each contest.
When satisfied with the setup press OK. You will then have
the opportunity to specify the location and name of the cabrillo output
file.
<br>

If you use the \ref contest_how_to_page \<XBEG\>...\<XEND\> to
capture your outgoing exchange, OR if you choose to capture all received
exchange information in the "Exch" field on the  \ref logbook_page panel then
you should be careful not to duplicate the data in the Caprillo report. For
example:
<br>

You captured outgoing exchange data as \<XBEG\>\<RST\> \<CNTR\>\<XEND\>. Do
not enable the "RST sent" and "Serial # out" check boxes as this info is
already contained in the "Exchange in" field.
<br>

You captured incoming exchange data into the Exch field as RST SER#
TIME. Do not enable the "RST rcvd" or the "Serial # in" check
boxes.
<br>

You must then open the file with a plain text editor and
modify the appropriate entries. Check with each contest sponsor
to see what their requirements are.
<br>
