\section Audio Alerts

There are occassions when your attention is not given fully to the computer
screen, but you would like to know when a digital event takes place.  You
might for instance like to know when the signal decodes the character sequence
"CQ CQ" or when your call sign is decoded.  You might be waiting for the start
of a net that is preluded by an RsID signal.  In all of these instances, and more,
you can set up fldigi to provide an audio signal alert to the default audio
device.

\section Configuring Audio Alerts

The PSK / RTTY / CW signal browser can be set up to search for incoming text
strings.  As the text string is detected in a browser line the color of the
line text will change to indicate the text presence.  The detection text can
be a general regular expression, but most commonly is a simple text string
such as "CQ CQ".

</center>

The regex detection defaults to red text.  The detection of <MYCALL> is an integral
part of the browser code.  A <MYCALL> detection causes the text to turn green.

Both of these events can trigger an audio alert.

</center>

The regex audio alert is shown using an external wav file "barbershop-mail.wav", and
the MYCALL audio alert is shown using an internal wav file "beeboo", a sound similar
to a european emergency vehicle siren.  If you use a wav file that you have
either created yourself or downloaded from the internet try to keep it's size less 
than 300 Kb and it's duration to less than 5 seconds.  The idea is to provide an
audio alert, not play music.  Hi fidelity is not important, so most 8000 sample/sec
monophonic wav files will suffice.  Look at this web site for a large selection
of audio clips:

You can also enable an alert for these conditions:
<ul>
<li> receipt of an flmsg text</li>
<li> time out of a flmsg reception</li>
<li> detection of an RsID signal</li>
</ul>
You can test the efficacy of the audio alert using the "Test" button associated
with each of the alerts.  Normal signal processing and user interaction with the
program will not be effected by the audio alert.  The alert playback is handled in
a separate thread and occurs as a background process.

Select an internal audio alert signal using the "Sound" selector

or a wav file on your computer using the associated "Select" button.

\subsection audio_alerts_caution WARNING

DO NOT enable audio alerts if you are using the default audio device for fldigi
transmit audio.  You will be a very unwelcome neighbor if your start transmitting
steam engine or diesel train whistles over the air!

\section macro_audio_alerts Macro Audio Alerts

Two new macro tags provide support for function key initiated audio alert playback

<ALERT:internal-wav> where internal-wav may be one of
<ul>
<li>bark - barking dog</li>
<li>checkout - George Carlin - check out what's new</li>
<li>diesel - diesel train horn</li>
<li>steam train - steam train whistle</li>
<li>doesnot - computer voice, "that does not compute"</li>
<li>beeboo - occulting two-tone sound similar to euro police car</li>
<li>phone - ringing telephone</li>
<li>dinner bell - similar to cruise ship dinner bell</li>
</ul>
or <ALERT:path-name-to-wav-file>
Audio playback using the macro tag is immediate upon pressing the associated function key.

\section notifier_events Notifier Audio Alerts

You can create special audio alerts using the Notifications dialog
<center>
\image html notifier-alert-1.png ""
\image latex notifier-alert-1.png "" width=4.0in
\image html notifier-alert-2.png ""
\image latex notifier-alert-2.png "" width=4.0in
</center>

The notifier event is set up using the these \ref notifier_page "instructions" with the addition
of the audio macro event added to the text appended to the TX text.  This
text is never actually sent, but triggers the audio event playback using the
macro facility.
