The RTTY modulator and demodulator have been extensively changed with
version 3.21.67.  The new design was a cooperative effort of
Stefan, DO2SMF, and Dave, W1HKJ with extensive testing performed by Ed,
W3NR, and Dick, AA5VU.  Chen, W7AY, was a silent contributor to
the design by virtue of his excellent technical papers on RTTY
modulation and demodulation, which he so generously placed in the
public domain.
<br>

fldigi can operate on a wide range of RTTY symbol rates and bandwidths. The
selection of symbol rate and bandwidth is made on
the \ref rtty_fsk_configuration_page "RTTY configuration tab".  The three most
common in amateur radio use can be selected from the mode menu.  These are
<br>

<center>

Mode    | Symbol Rate | Typing Speed       | Bandwidth
:------:|:-----------:|:------------------:|:----------:
RTTY 45 | 45.45 baud  | 6.0 cps (60 wpm)   | 270 Hz
RTTY 50 | 50.0 baud   | 6.6 cps (66 wpm)   | 280 Hz
RTTY 75 | 75.0 baud   | 10.0 cps (100 wpm) | 370 Hz

</center>
<br>

These modes were a result of mechanical and electrical
designs of the early TTY machines.  The 45.45 baud and 75 baud
machines were for the US / Canadian market and used 60 Hz
synchronous motors.  The 50 baud machines were for the European
market and used 50 Hz synchronous motors.
<br>
<br>

fldigi can encode and decode many other symbol rates and bandwidths.  "Custom"
combinations are set up on the RTTY configuration tab.  You
probably will never have to do that unless you like experimenting with
unusual RTTY modes.

\section rtty_modulator RTTY modulator


All of the modem signals that fldigi produces are audio signals.  That
includes the RTTY signal.  fldigi can encode and decode an RTTY signal
that is anywhere within the passband of the sideband transceiver.  It is
not limited to the traditional tone pairs around 2100 Hz.  Each of
the generated Mark / Space signals are on-off-keyed (OOK), bandwidth
limited signals.  The resultant waveform is not an FM type signal
of constant amplitude.  Therefore the <b>transmit audio and RF
amplifiers must be linear</b>, just like the requirement for PSK signals.
There are performance gains using this approach.  The principal being a
reduction in inter symbol interference which gives much improved
performance by the receiver.  The waterfall, time domain, and
spectrum signatures of the transmitted signal look like this:

You must operate your transceiver in the USB
mode for the fldigi RTTY signal to be the correct polarity.  If your
transceiver is set to LSB then use the fldigi "Rev" button to reverse
the sense of the mark and space signals.
<br>

You must maintain transmitter LINEARITY in the AUDIO AMPLIFIERs.
Do not think that you can improve performance by over driving the audio
input.  A good operating procedure for most transceivers is the
set the audio level to the level for which there is just barely a hint
of ALC.  Then reduce the input to 80% of that power level.
Over driving an AFSK signal is as disastrous as over driving a PSK
signal.  This is an actual on air signal that was being over
driven (but not on purpose):

Joe also performed a series of tests on an Icom 706 mkIIg transceiver.  The
results of those tests are very enlightening.
<br>

"Two views - the 2 KHz span and a 10 KHz span.  The 10 KHz span
shows the one failing of the IC-706mkIIg and other rigs with analog
modulation - opposite sideband and carrier leakage.  This one
isn't too bad but one can see carrier at -50 dBc and opposite sideband
at -55 dBc +/-.   I do use a high audio frequency to minimize
harmonic issues.
<br>

For fun I've attached versions at 70 W in 10K, 5K, and 2K spans.  The narrow
spans clearly show the benefits of reducing the audio until output power
drops 1.5 dB.
<br>

Audio was connected to the IC-706mkIIg via the "DATA" jack rather
than the mic connector or "Mod In" pin of the ACC jack.  Using this
input avoids several potential problems - including the constant
swapping between mic and digital connections and remembering to turn off the
compressor when switching to digital operation.  The "Data" input is
also 6 dB less sensitive than "Mod in" making it that much less likely
that one will significantly over drive the the transceiver and create
distortion in the audio stages ahead of the modulator".

\section rtty_demodulator RTTY demodulator

Fldigi's demodulator uses a design based on theoretical work published by
Kok Chen, W7AY,
<a href="http://www.w7ay.net/site/Technical/ATC/">

<br>

<br>

The mark and space signals are
converted to base band and then filtered in a low pass filter.
Each filter is a variant of Chen's enhanced Nyquist filter.  It is
implemented using a Fast Overlap-and-Add Fourier Transform.
<br>

Each time the baud rate is selected the program must "rebuild" the
digital RTTY filter.  The filter parameters are optimized for the
baud rate.
<br>

The detector is an optimized Automatic Threshold Correcting (ATC) type
described in Chen's paper.
<br>

To start decoding a signal simply left click on the signal and the AFC should
lock on to the signal.
<br>

The digiscope display will extinguish when the Rx signal level falls below
the squelch setting.
<br>

Many amateur transceivers offer native FSK support for RTTY.  This support 
also included RTTY-centric filters and optimizations that 
operators have wanted to use.  This native transceiver RTTY support is 
where the radio itself creates the MARK and SPACE signals but the key 
up/down and timing is done externally via say a hardware TNC or other 
device.

It is possible to use fldigi to generate the keying waveform for use with 
such a transceiver.    See \ref pseudo_fsk_page "Pseudo FSK for a 
description of how this can be accomplished.

Fldigi also supports a few external hardware devices for FSK-based RTTY 
support<br>
