fldigi does not have a direct connection for uploading and downloading LoTW
records.  Instead, it uses the tqsl program that each LoTW user will have on
his or her computer.  The tqsl program is usually used with it's graphics
user interface, especially on Windows and OS X computers.  But it also can
be opened in a 'command line' mode in which the user dialog is never visible.
fldigi passes the logbook records as a batch adif file via tqsl using this
command line mode.

Open the LoTW configuration dialog from the Logbook menu:

\section LOTW_configuration LoTW configuration

Use the "Locate" button to open an OS file finder dialog to locate the tqsl
binary.  Click on it when found.  The above image shows this on a Linux
computer.  On OS X you need to open the Applications folder,
and then drag and drop the tqsl icon on to the 'tqsl:' control.  You will see
/Applications/tqsl.app in that control after the drag and drop.

The Callsign Certificate used to digitally sign QSOs being uploaded (and 
typically specified in a Station Location) can optionally be password protected 
if the user is running TQSL on a public or physically unprotected computer. For 
typical home use, this is unnecessary; instructions for removing a password from 
a Callsign Certificate are here:
\verbatim
<https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/removecertificatepassword/>
\endverbatim
If you use are using a password protected certificate you need to enter that 
in the Password control and also enable the "Use password..." check button.

Many users will need only one "Callsign Certificate", but those who operate 
using club or contest callsigns, who occasionally operate /P or /QRP, or who 
operate from other DXCC entities will have more than one. Users who operate 
from more than one geographic location, e.g. county or NPOTA or SOTA activators, 
must define a "Station Location" for each such location. When submitting a group 
QSOs to LoTW via TQSL's command line interface, you must specify a 
Station Location; if the specified Station Location doesn't specify a 
Callsign Certificate, you must also specify a Callsign Certificate.  All QSOs 
in the submitted group must thus have been made using the same over the air 
callsign and from the same geographic location.

Leave the "Quiet mode" unchecked until you are comfortable with fldigi's LoTW
interface.  If unchecked the tqsl dialog will open each time the "Send" button
is selected.  Checked and the tqsl dialog will not open.

If you never tweak the logbook entries, then enable the "Send QSO data..." check
box.  If checked each saved logbook entry will be sent individually to LoTW via
the tqsl interface.  Leave it unchecked if you want to review and possibly modify
the records before the LoTW upload.  When unchecked, fldigi will accumulate the
adif records in an adif upload file.  This file is not on disk.  It is only a
memory image of the file and is therefore volatile.  Exit fldigi before submitting
the LoTW records for upload and the memory image is lost.  BUT the data is still
available for LoTW upload.

\section LOTW_usage LoTW usage

fldigi sends adif records to LoTW via the tqsl command line interface.  tqsl acts
upon a set of adif records in an upload file that fldigi creates for that purpose.
All update files are in the fldigi files sub-folder "LOTW".  The upload file is
created when the Send button is pressed and the tqsl binary is invoked.

An in memory image of that file is created as described above and can be reviewed and
edited using the Check button.  The LoTW Review dialog will only appear if there are
records ready for upload.

\image html lotw-review.png ""
\image latex lotw-review.png "" width=5.0in

The text box is an fairly complete text editor.  You can modify or delete a record line, or
just clear the entire image file contents.  If you modify the file then you must
save it before taking any subsequent action to upload the file to LoTW.  Be sure
you fully understand how to change the ADIF record before attempting to make
changes.  tqsl will reject mangled records.

You can create a new update file image, or append new (or corrected) records using the Export
button.  This will open the Export dialog:

\image html lotw-export.png ""
\image latex lotw-export.png "" width=5.0in

Press the LoTW button to present the field selection.  Then select the desired records
either individually, all, or within a date block.  The above image shows a date
selection of all records between July 1 and October 31 of this year.  When OK
is pressed the upload image file will either be newly created or appended with the
selected records.

View the upload image file again to insure you have not duplicated any records.
tqsl will reject any that are duplicates if you forget this step.

When all looks OK you can upload the records using the Send button on the LoTW config
dialog.

\section LoTW_verification Matching with online LoTW records

Download a set of adif records from LoTW using the LoTW web interface.  Save
the download file to a convenient location.  Then press the "Match" button and fldigi will
try to match your records with each LoTW download record; updating each
matched record's LoTW date received data element.  If the LoTW download was
make using an extended format than fldigi will also update these adif fields
if present in the LoTW record:
<ul>
  <li>LOTWRDATE - LoTW received date</li>
  <li>DXCC - dxcc entity number</li>
  <li>CNTY - county name</li>
  <li>COUNTRY - country name</li>
  <li>CQZ - CQ zone number</li>
  <li>GRIDSQUARE - Maidenhead grid square reported by QSL's station</li>
</ul>
A brief report will be given in a message dialog at the conclusion of the matching effort.
