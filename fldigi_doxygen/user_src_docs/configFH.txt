The Hellschreiber modes all use a video display that is basically a
character-by-character facsimile. The shape of the characters is
determined at the transmitting station. You can select from 15
different fonts, all of which have been designed for Feld Hell use.
In normal use each dot of the character font is transmitted
twice. You can increase the effective video s/n by transmitting
the dots 2 or 3 times the normal. That is controlled by the
Transmit width. <br>
<br>

FeldHell is a pulse amplitude modulated
signal. The shape of the pulse is a raised cosine. This
helps to control the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. It is
customary to use a 4 millisecond risetime for the raised cosine,
especially on HF. You can change that to 2 milliseconds.
The video edges will be sharper, but the bandwidth twice as
large. You might find 2 msec a better choice for VHF and above.<br>
<br>

Decoded FeldHell transmissions are displayed as a raw video raster.
The video is displayed as black characters on a white background.  Enable
the "Reverse video" control for a white on black display.<br>

The default display mode is for each line of text to be displayed in the
lowest line, characters appended in a left to right fashion.  The lines
scroll up as each line is filled.  You can select "Marquee text" mode if
you prefer to have the characters scroll from right to left as on a movie marquee.
Marquee text is suitable if you are only viewing a single line of text.<br>

Both the width and height of the characters can be adjusted.  The Feld Hell
character is transmitted using a 7x14 or 8x14 array of dots.  The character display
height can be adjusted from 14 to 42 pixels, with 14, 28 and 42 being multiples
of the transmitted rate.  The height can be adjusted in units of 2 pixels.
Remember that each vertical part of the character array is sent twice.  The
on screen display height for each row will than be twice the selected height, i.e.
28 to 84 pixels.<br>

The width is adjustable as 1x, 2x, 3x and 4x the received array.  I suggest
you begin with the Rx Width Multiplier set to 2 and the Rx Height in pixels set
to 28.  Move the Rx/Tx panel divider up or down to see fewer or more raster
lines.<br>

The Rx AGC control sets the decay rate of the decoder average signal level.
Lower numbers is slower and larger a faster decay rate.<br>

As you change Hellschreiber modes the optimum filter bandwidth will be
set. You can change that and might find a narrower filter
effective if you are experiencing CWI interference. FeldHell is
susceptible to CWI. If you narrow the filter to much the received video
will become blurred.<br>
