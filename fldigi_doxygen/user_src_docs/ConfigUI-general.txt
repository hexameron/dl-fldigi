Fldigi offers tips on the use of nearly every aspect of its operation.
These are particularly useful when you first use the program, but
after you are familiar with it's operation they tend to get in the way.
You can turn them off by de-selecting "Show tooltips"
<br>

Some users prefer to not have icons on the menu system. You can turn
them off also.
<br>

Fldigi offers three different look and feel based on the parent Fast Light
Toolkit graphics interface; "base", "gtk+" and "plastic". These
can be combined with command line specifiers for the default background
and foreground colors to create a user unique look to fldigi. You
will probably discover that the default colors and the gtk+ UI scheme
are to be preferred.
<br>

Fldigi has internationalization files for French, Italian, Polish and
Spanish. These control the contents of various menu items and
labels. Linux users should build and install fldigi from source
to gain access to these. Windows users should select the language
of choice from the list, press the "Save" button and then close and
restart fldigi. The "UI language" selector is only present on the
Windows version of fldigi. The percentage indicates the
completeness of the translation.
<br>

CW, RTTY (baudot), THROB,
and CONTESTIA are modes that only transmit in upper case
characters. They also have a very limited set of non-alpha
characters. A screen full of UPPERCASE characters can be
stressful. Select this option to print all of this text in lower
case
<br>

fldigi's deadman timer can be set from 0 to 60 minutes in 1 minute intervals.
Zero disables the deadman timer.  If enabled the deadman timer will be shown
on the fldigi menu bar.  The timer is restarted whenever one of these events
occurs
<ul>
<li>machine state changes to Tx</li>
<li>machine state changes to Tune</li>
<li>a macro character is transmited</li>
<li>an xmlrpc text character is transmited</li>
<li>an ARQ character is transmitted</li>
<li>a TX panel character is transmitted</li>
<li>at end of all image transmissions, deadman stopped at start of image</li>
</ul>
<br>
Select the configuration items to allow prompting when exiting the
program. Note that the prompts are only active if the menu item
File/Exit is used.
<br>

You can elect to have the program check for updates every time it is
started. You can also manually check for updates from the "Help /
Check for updates" menu item.

<br>

You may not want to use all possible modes when operating fldigi.
Press the "Visible modes" button and open the mode selector dialog.
<br>

The use of this dialog should be obvious after a few clicks here and there.
<br>

By deselecting all but CW, PSK31, PSK63 and RTTY
the Op_Mode menu is uncluttered of all the other modes. The WWV
and Freq Analysis modes are always visible. When a subset of the
entire mode bank is selected a new menu item is added to the Op_Mode
menu, "Show all modes". This is a toggle to restore all modes to
the menu. The inverse toggle is "Show fewer modes."
