The same control is used for both manual entry of the
transceiver frequency or with full CAT control.  When no CAT is available
the control is simply a convenient way of keeping track of the transceiver
USB/LSB suppressed carrier frequency, the mode and the audio tracking
point.  If fldigi is being used with an FM transceiver you probably should
enter the simplex frequency or the input frequency of a repeater being
used.  This frequency value is used with the waterfall audio frequency to
compute the logged frequency.  The logged frequency value will only be
correct for LSB and USB operation.
<br>

The combo box on the left will allow the selection and control of the
operating mode of the transceiver.
<br>

The combo box on the right will allow the selection and control of the
transceiver bandwidth.
<br>

The frequency display is in fact a set of special buttons.  Each
digit may be increment by clicking/pressing on the upper half of the digit and
decrement by clicking/pressing the lower half of the digit.  The leading
digits will follow suit if a decade rollover occurs.  You can also place the
mouse cursor on a digit and then use the mouse wheel to roll the frequency
up and down.
<br>

Manual entry of frequency can be accomplished by hovering the mouse pointer
over the frequency display and entering the desired frequency (in Khz) via
the keyboard. Pressing \<return\> or \<enter\> on completion sets the
frequency to an active state, effecting rig control and future log entires.
Don't forget the decimal point if you are entering a fractional KHz value.
<br>

The Smeter / Power-meter display is only active if fldigi is configured for xmlrpc
control with flrig.  The transceiver must support the smeter and power out CAT query.
fldigi does not try to estimate the smeter reading based on the audio stream.
You can toggle viewing the Smeter / Power-meter display using the button just to
the right of the shared space used by the "Smeter/Power-meter" and the "Mode/Bandwidth"
controls.  Be sure to save the configuration for this to persist the next
time fldigi is executed.
<br>

The mode combobox, the bandwidth combobox and the frequency display
also annunciate the current transceiver status.  If you change
operating mode on the transceiver, that will be annunciated in the
respective combobox and FLDigi will adjust any internal parameters
accordingly.  FLDigi queries the transceiver 10 times per second
to maintain a lock step with the transceiver.

\section frequencies_list Frequency List

The frequency/mode pick list is displayed when the book button is
pressed.  Pressing the book button a second time will restore the
original logging panel.
<br>

The pick list buttons control selecting, adding and deleting entries in
the frequency/mode list.
<br>

<ul>
	<li>add the current frequency / mode / audio track point to the list</li>
	<li>select the current list entry</li>
	<li>delete the highlighted entry from the list</li>
	<li>delete all entries from the list (a warning prompt will appear)</li>
	<li>show active frequencies based on either the entry field to the
	right or the stations locator,
	see \ref psk_reporter_page "pskreporter/spotter".</li>
	<li>entry field for active frequencies search, for example "EM."</li>
</ul>


The browser list contains frequency, sideband, modem type, audio
frequency, and a text describing usage.  To edit the usage string:
<ul>
<li>highlight the entry to be edited</li>
<li>press the combination of SHIFT and right arrow while pointing to the line</li>
</ul>
This will hide the frequencies browser and display the data relative to that line

Edit the text entry and press the "Enter" button when finished.

The list is saved when fldigi is shut down.
