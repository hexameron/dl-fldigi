fldigi can connect to and share data with an external program called "fdserver."
fdserver is implemented in a scripting language called TclTk.  TclTk scripts can
be run on Linux, OS X, and all current versions of Windows.  The look and feel of the
TclTk application is nearly identical across all of the platforms.  fdserver uses a
socket interface to communicate with compatible clients on the same computer or with
others on a LAN configuration.  The fdserver main dialog on a Linux computer:

\image html fdserver-main.png ""
\image latex fdserver-main.png "" width=6.0in

with two clients shown as connected, W1HKJ on 40 meter digital, and K2LBM on 17 meter digital.

Open fldigi's fdclient dialg from the main Log menu:

\image latex menu-logbook.png "" width=1.3in

\image latex fldigi-fdclient.png "" width=6.0in

Enter the operator callsign which may be the same as the station callsign or
different in the case of multi-operator participation.  Make sure that the 
tcpip address and port are correct (the same as configured for the server).  If
the fdserver is on a different computer then the tcpip addr is either the
32 bit address in Dot-decimal notation (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx), or the LAN recognized DNS
name such as "daves-linux-box".  Most LAN routers maintain a DNS server that matches
noun name to the 32 bit address.  (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4).
<br>

Enable the "connect" check box and fldigi should immediately find and connect to
the fdserver.  The connected indicator will change from medium grey to green.
<br>

fdserver will only allow a single position to be logged in for a band/mode.  Event
management is up to the event participants.
<br>

fdserver stores each contact with the operator Call.  Refer to the separate
fdserver/fdclient documentation for details.
<br>

Immediately after connecting the fdserver will provide fldigi with
<ul>
<li>FD Call</li>
<li>FD Class</li>
<li>FD Section</li>
<li>FD Mult</li>
<li>Score</li>
</ul>
The server will broadcast changes to the various logging events, such as a new 
20 meter CW contact.  Each fdserver client, whether the TclTk fdclient application or
fldigi can quickly see the event activities on the client dialog.

Logging off of the fdserver is as simple as unchecking the "connect" box.

\section fdserver FDserver/FDclient

Here are some simple startup and running instructions for the TclTk applications,
fdserver.tcl and fdclient.tcl.
<br>

You must have the tcltk/wish interpreter installed on your computer.  When installed
the file manager will usually associate the .tcl extension with the server and allow
the interpreter to be run and execute the target script file.  tcltk script files
are plain ASCII text and can be edited with a proper text editor (DO NOT use Notepad on Windows).
Notepad++ and Geany are both available for Windows and are free.
<br>

<b>fdserver</b>
<br>

Start fdserver.tcl and you are presented with it's configuration dialog:
\image html fd-server-init.png ""
\image latex fd-server-init.png "" width=2.5in

Enter
<ul>
<li>Station  - the station call for the FD event</li>
<li>Mult     - the station multiplier for the FD event</li>
<li>Class    - the station class for the FD event</li>
<li>Section  - the station section for the FD event</li>
<li>Autosave - interval in seconds between updating the database file</li>
<li>DBfile   - name of the field day log file</li>
<li>TCPIP_address - use 127.0.0.1, local host</li>
<li>TCPIP_port    - default is 20001</li>
</ul>
Press OK and the main fdserver dialog opens and is ready to accept clients.

<b>fdclient</b>

Start fdclient.tcl and the main fdclient dialog opens:

\image html fdclient-main.png ""
\image latex fdclient-main.png "" width=6.0in

Press the "LogOn" button to open the client log on dialog

\image html fdclient-logon.png ""
\image latex fdclient-logon.png "" width=6.0in

Select the band and mode.  Enter the Operator Callsign and press OK.
<br>

The fdclient main dialog will show connected with the same type of information
that is shown on the fldigi fdclient dialog.
<br>

The fdclient.tcl application can be used for phone, and CW operations that do
not use fldigi.
