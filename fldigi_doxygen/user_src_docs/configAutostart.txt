You can configure fldigi to start up to seven external programs when
it begins execution
<ul>
<li>flrig - Transceiver controller</li>
<li>flamp - Amateur Multicast Protocol</li>
<li>flnet - Net Control Operator database and logger</li>
<li>fllog - fldigi compatible log server for multiple clients</li>
<li>Prog 1..3 - user selectable programs</li>
</ul>
\section autostart_program_selection Program Selection
The location of each autostart program must be identified and entered into
the respective text control.  Use the \"Locate\" button to open a file browser.
Select the executable and the full pathname to that file will be
entered for you.  You can also enter or modify each entry manually.  The
entry will appear similar to:
<br>
Operating System | Entry
:----------------|:----------------------------------------------
Windows XP       |C:\\Progam Files\\flrig-1.3.31\\flrig.exe
Windows 7        |C:\\Program Files (x86)\\flrig-1.3.31\\flrig.exe
Windows 10       |C:\\Program Files\\flrig-1.3.31\\flrig.exe
Linux            |/usr/local/bin/flrig
OS X             |/Applications/flrig-1.3.31.app
<br>
On OS X you simply drag the application icon (in the Applications folder) to
the respective text control.
<br>
The OS X "app" paradigm embeds the actual "unix binary" within the structure
of the app directory (folder), i.e.
<ul>
<li>/Applications/flmsg.app</li>
<li>/Applications/flmsg.app/flmsg-4.0.3/Contents/MacOS/flmsg</li>
</ul>
Either the 1st or 2nd can be entered into the autostart control.  If  the
first then fldigi will search for the unix binary pathname within the 
construct of the app directory.

</center>
Prog 1:, Prog2:, and Prog3: will all start the correct application when 
pressing the respective Test button.  Note that the unix binary for 
flcluster is tagged with the name "exec" in the Finder.  Prog 1 uses the 
system "open" to start Athena, the logbook program associated with the 
lgbkdb extension.<br>
<br>
If the /*.app/*/Contents/MacOS/ folder has more than one file and both 
are tagged as "exec" then fldigi may not reference the correct one.  
In that case it is necessary to use the second format.<br>
<br>
Drag the "app" icon to the control and the 1st entry results.  Drag the 
"exec" icon to the control and 2nd entry results.<br>
<br>
You must become conversant with the Unix directory system if you are 
working from within the context of an OS X terminal window.  Open a 
terminal window and enter<br>
<br>
echo $PATH<br>
<br>
at the command line prompt.  The terminal shell program should respond with:<br>
<br>
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:<br>
<br>
which is the order in which directories will be searched to find a terminal 
reference binary.  The OS X terminal shell program does NOT search the app
folders for an executable.  If you want to execute an app exec binary from
the terminal window it is necessary to enter the full Unix pathname to that
executable, i.e.<br>
<br>
/Applications/fldigi-4.0.13/Contents/MacOS/fldigi

\section autostart_test Testing-Enabling
You can test, or manually start each of the autostart programs using the
respective \"Test\" button.  If the desired application launches correctly you
can check the Enable box for that application to have it launch when starting
fldigi.<br>
